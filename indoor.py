# This code was made while learning Python by classroom course and by practicing coding in VSC.
# The name of the classroom course is: Harvard's CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python.

# The purpose of this code is to take any input that the user 
# enters (letters, symbols and/or numbers) and turn all of them 
# into lower case output.

# User enters the input
quote = (input("What is that you want to say? "))

# Text gets printed with all lowercase letters:
print(quote.lower())
